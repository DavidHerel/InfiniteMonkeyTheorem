# # Step 1: The Population
# # Create a population with random DNA

# draw()
# # Step 1: Selection
# # Create an empty mating pool
# #  For every member of the population, evaluate its fitness based on some criteria (objective function)
# # and add it to the mating pool. The more fit it is the more times it appears in mating pool,
# # in order to be more likely to picked for reproduction

# # Step 2: Reproduction
# # Fill the new population by executing the following steps:
# # 1. Pick tow parents objects from the mating pool
# # 2. Crossover -- create a child object by mating these two parents
# # 3. Mutation -- mmutate the childs DNA based on given probability
# # 4. Add the child object to the new population
# # Replace the old population with the new population

# # Rinse and repeat
